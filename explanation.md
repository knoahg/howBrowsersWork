# howBrowsersWork

The World Wide Web works on a client/server model. Requests are sent by the client to the server for them to be processed and the feedback is given on the interface or computer for that matter.
Examples of web browsers include google chrome, firefox, safari, opera, internet explorer just to mention a few.
The pages sent to the server are normally in the form of HyperText Markup language (HTML) of which the browsers interpret them and display them on your computer. They also display applications, animations programs and material created with programming languages such as javascript, java and AJAX in the event that all the content does not work plug-ins should be installed for full performance.


The code in the HTML files tells your browser how to display the text, graphics and multimedia content on the home page through HTML references as the browser itself does not have the content. 
HTML tags are also interpreted by the web browser as links to other websites or other web resources.
HTML code specifies the link as another home page the browser retrieves the URL specified in the HTML file when the user clicks the underlined link on the page. If the HTML code specifies a file to be downloaded it is then downloaded to your computer automatically to the specified download destination.

COMMON BROWSER MESSAGES

a) Server does not have DNS entry.

When you type a URL the browser contacts the Domain Name Server (DNS) which translates the URL to an IP number that the computer can understand. If you do not get a response it means the server does not have a listing of the URL you specified.

b) Access Forbidden- Too many users are connected.

These apply to websites that limit the number of users due to heavy traffic and in some cases it completely shuts down due to heavy traffic. If the maximum number of people are on the website, you have to wait for someone to logout for you to gain entry.

c) Unauthorized or 403 forbidden

This means you are entering a website that only allows certain people to access it. Typically they are password protected and entering the wrong password will not give you access.
